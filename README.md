# node-js-learner
A Node JS starter learning project. Here we'll be setting up a server that has the ability to receive data via "POST" & save it to a local data object. Then load said data object with a "GET" request.

## Resources.
While testing for the server project, I realized that on of the cloud hosting services could be used. I picked Azure to test with, and my setup got alot of influence from their guide to setup an Express server, [found here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/azure/app-service/containers/quickstart-nodejs).

Specifically I reviewed the express-generator myExpressApp with the PUG template engine. This gave me insite how I can log server process's and start creating a HTML template building within a server as well.
